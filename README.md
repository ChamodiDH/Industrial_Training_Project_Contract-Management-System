 
 Contract Management System
 
 This system is a Construction management system which we selected as the Industrial Training Project in the 2nd Year 2nd Semester of SLIIT.
 This project was done using ASP.net frame work with C#. MSSQL was used as the database.
 This Contract Management System which is a sub system of construction management system was done by me. According to this system Contract manager prepare estimations
of raw materials and labour.Contract manager can update the details of a paricular estimation and if necessasary can delete old estimations as well.
Based on the details of raw material and labour estimations contract manager can generate a final report which contains the total estimation cost of a particular tender.
This final estimation report can be downloaded in pdf format and email to the customer directly from the system.
